## Course schedule 

In order to run these tutorials online, without installing anything, you can follow the following link. 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DawievLill/Macro-318/HEAD)

Once the program has finished running you need to go to the notebooks folder and then click on the appropriate notebook. 

This course schedule will be updated frequently, so please check before the tutorial for the video recording and notes. The links to the notebooks can also be found below. However, these are not interactive, so you can not run them unless you have Python, Julia and Jupyter installed on your computer. You will only be able to view their content. I will speak about this some more in the lecture.

## Final project

In this part of the course there is no exam, only a final project. We will discuss this project in more detail during the semester. However, the basic idea is that you apply machine learning techniques to any type of data that you find interesting. The topic should ideally be related to economics. Please consult with me about your topics, so that we can talk about the availability of data and whether the project is feasible.
