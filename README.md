# Macroeconomics 318 Tutorials 

These turorials provide an introduction to computational methods for macroeconomics. 

Most of the material will also be made available via SUNLearn. However, for the most up to date version of the work you can refer here. 

It is not required that you know how `git` and `Github` works in order to work through the tutorials. I will give some basic instructions in the first tutorial, so those that want to delve more into version control are able to get started.  

Below are my details. You can contact me via email.

## Course schedule 

In order to run these tutorials online, without installing anything, you can follow the following link. 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DawievLill/Macro-318/HEAD)

Once the program has finished running you need to go to the notebooks folder and then click on the appropriate notebook. 

This course schedule will be updated frequently, so please check before the tutorial for the video recording and notes. The links to the notebooks can also be found below. However, these are not interactive, so you can not run them unless you have Python, Julia and Jupyter installed on your computer. You will only be able to view their content. I will speak about this some more in the lecture.

## Tutorial exercises

In this class we will be doing several tutorial exercises. Some of them will be done by hand and others on computer. The exercises for each week will be posted on this Github page as soon as possible. I will also post them on SUNLearn if that is easier to access for students. 

## Resources

For a good introduction to Julia I would recommend, 

- [Julia] QuantEcon. Getting Started with Julia. https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/index.html
- [Julia] Paul Soderlind. Julia Tutorial. https://github.com/PaulSoderlind/JuliaTutorial
- [Julia] Czech Technical University. Julia for Optimasation and Learning. https://juliateachingctu.github.io/Julia-for-Optimization-and-Learning/stable/
- [Julia] Ben Lauwens and Allen Downey (2018). Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html

Good introductory notes for computational economics that use Python are the following

- [Python] Fedor Iskhakov. Foundations of Computational Economics. https://fedor.iskh.me/compecon
- [Python] Jeppe Druedahl. Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis. https://numeconcopenhagen.netlify.app/

I have used these resources to compile these notes and tried to give the proper acknowledgment throughout. 

**Textbook**: Williamson, S. Macroeconomics. 4th edition.
