    "\n",
    "Now we can enter these $x_1$ and $x_2$ values into the utility function. The shape of the utility function as initialised is a $N \\times N$ matrix of zeros. We are currently busy with $i = 1$ and $j = 1$. This means that in our code we are looking at `u_values[1, 1]` which is the value in the first column and first row of the matrix. \n",

    "To be clear, `u_values[1, 1]` takes on the value from the output of `u_func(0.1, 0.1)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we keep the $i$ component fixed at $1$ and iterate over the next value in the $j$ sequence, which is $j = 2$. We repeat the steps as for the above description and end up with an entry for `u_values[1, 2]`. \n",
    "\n",
