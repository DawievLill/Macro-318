    "\n",
    "To use an example, we start with $i = 1$, and then run the loop over all the $j$ values starting at $j = 1$ and ending at $j = N = 100$. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now we can enter these $x_1$ and $x_2$ values into the utility function. The shape of the utility function as initialised is a $N \\times N$ matrix of zeros. We are currently busy with $i = 1$ and $j = 1$. This means that in our code we are looking at `u_values[1, 1]` which is the value in the first column and first row of the matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, `u_values[1, 1]` takes on the value from the output of `u_func(0.1, 0.1)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we keep the $i$ component fixed at $1$ and iterate over the next value in the $j$ sequence, which is $j = 2$. We repeat the steps as for the above description and end up with an entry for `u_values[1, 2]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping $i$ fixed, we iterate over all the values for $j$. That means for $j = 3$ to $j = 100$. After having completed this loop, we move on to a new value for $i$. \n",

    "At the end of all of this you will see that we have know completely filled the `u_values` matrix with all possible combinations of $x_1$ and $x_2$ values (smaller than $x_{max} = 10$) that can enter the utility function. "

    "On the other extreme with respect to the grid, we have $x_1 = I/p_1$. If you think about this carefully, $x_1$ can only take on the value of $I/p_1$ if $x_2 = 0$. This can be seen from the budget constraint $p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2} \\leq I$.\n",

    "Our endpoints for the grid have now been defined as $0$ and $I/p_1$. The grid in our case is equally spaced, which means that the second point in the grid is equally far away from the first and third point. The fact that any point is equally far from adjacent points, is true for any singular point on the grid (except for the two endpoints). There is a symmetry in the spacing between points. \n",

    "The next question is, how can we create this grid mathematically so that we have this equal spacing. If there are $N_1 = 5$ grid points, then we know that the endpoints make up two of the points. So these are accounted for. Now we need to think about the other $3$ points.

For equal distances between $5$ points, where the distances must sum to one, we need the distance between each point to be $1/N_1 - 1 = 1 / 4$. If you look carefully, you will see that there are four positions in between grid points, and so we need each of these to be of length $1/4$, so that these $4$ intervals can sum to $1$.\n",
