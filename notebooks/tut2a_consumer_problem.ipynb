    "For our first algorithm, we are basically going to loop through a grid of all the $N_{1} \\times N_{2}$ solutions and then pick the best option. This has the advantage of being easy to understand. However, it requires evaluations many points and could be computationally very costly if the number of points that we need to evaluate are high. This type of method is referred to as a **grid search** method. It solves the problem with brute force. "
