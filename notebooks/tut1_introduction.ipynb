This is a short tutorial that is supposed to show you the basics of the Julia programming language. At the end of the tutorial you will see links to many more resources. These tutorials are a short introduction to the topics, so that you can get a feeling for what is on offer. "

Most of modern macroeconomic research involves utilising computational methods, so it is wortwhile to get comfortable with some basic programming skills. The return on this investment is quite high. If you are interested in this type of work, feel free to contact me to talk about computational economics in Honours and Masters. "
